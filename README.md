#  Glacier Calving Detection & Spatio-Temporal Analysis
**Computer Vision · Time-Lapse Imagery · Environmental Data Analysis**

This project presents an end-to-end computer vision workflow for detecting, analysing, and visualising glacier calving events using high-frequency time-lapse imagery.  
The study focuses on Hansbreen Glacier (Svalbard, 2016) and demonstrates how automated image analysis can reveal spatio-temporal patterns of calving activity under real-world conditions.

##  Dataset Description

This project uses high-frequency time-lapse imagery of the Hansbreen glacier terminus in Svalbard, collected as part of a long-term glaciological monitoring programme operated by the **Polish Polar Station (PPS)**.

Images were acquired between **17 May and 31 October 2016** using a **Canon EOS 1100D** camera (4272 × 2848 pixels, 18 mm focal length) at a nominal interval of **15 minutes**, powered by a solar-assisted system.

The dataset reflects realistic Arctic monitoring challenges, including:
- Irregular temporal gaps  
- Variable illumination (fog, sun glare, polar night)  
- Occasional camera shifts and tilt changes  

Images with insufficient visibility were removed, camera alignment was corrected, and the glacier terminus region was cropped for focused analysis.

##  Calving Event Detection

Calving events were detected automatically using **pairwise image differencing** between consecutive frames. Significant pixel-level changes were interpreted as potential calving activity.

Each detected event was treated as an individual observation and characterised by:
- Event timestamp  
- Event magnitude (pixel area as a proxy)  
- Spatial location (centroid coordinates)  

---

##  Exploratory Analytics

Detected events were aggregated to explore:
- Temporal trends in calving activity  
- Distribution of event sizes  
- Spatial distribution of calving locations  

An interactive dashboard was developed to support filtering by time period and event magnitude, enabling rapid quality control and exploratory analysis.

##  Spatial Heatmaps & Seasonal Patterns

Spatial heatmaps were generated by accumulating calving event centroids over a reference image. These visualisations highlight persistent calving hotspots and reveal non-uniform spatial behaviour along the glacier front.

Seasonal comparisons show increased calving activity and spatial spread during summer months compared to spring.

##  Terminus Zone-Based Analysis

To investigate spatial variability in more detail, the glacier terminus was divided into **longitudinal zones**. Each calving event was assigned to a zone based on its horizontal position.

This zonal approach enables direct comparison of calving behaviour across different sections of the glacier front.

##  Rule-Based Calving Style Classification

Calving events were classified into distinct **calving styles** using an interpretable, rule-based framework informed by:
- Event size  
- Vertical position relative to an estimated waterline  

The resulting categories include:
- Icefall  
- Waterline calving  
- Submarine calving  
- Sheet collapse

##  Zone-Based Calving Style Distribution

To assess spatial differences in calving behaviour, the relative proportions of calving styles were analysed within each terminus zone.

This analysis revealed clear **spatial heterogeneity**, with different zones exhibiting distinct dominant calving mechanisms.

##  Key Findings

- Over **500,000** calving-related change events detected  
- Strong spatial clustering along the glacier terminus  
- Clear seasonal intensification during summer  
- Distinct zonal differences in dominant calving styles  

These results highlight the influence of **local glacier geometry and ocean–ice interactions** on calving dynamics.

##  Future Work

Potential extensions of this work include:
- Optical flow or deep learning–based motion estimation  
- Physical calibration from pixels to real-world units  
- Integration with meteorological and oceanographic data  
- Validation against manually annotated calving inventories
